# Terraria Battles: The Twins

## ðŸŽ¬ Introduction

Welcome to Terraria!  The last thing you remember is collecting resources that were released into your world after defeating the Wall of Flesh.  It is currently 7PM, and you are having the feeling it's going to be a terrible night.  Using your new weapons, you will have to defeat the two mechanical eyes; Spazmatizm, the green eye of cursed flames, and Retinazor, the red eye with lazers.

You have until morning, or they will leave!

- [Melee](./scene1.md)
- [Range](./scene2.md)
- [Mage](./scene3.md)
- [Summoner](./scene4.md)
