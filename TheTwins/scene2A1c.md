As Spazmatizm rushes towards you, Your repeater firing ichor arrows lowers their defence as you hit it more and more the wounds starts to be noticable.  It begins to spin and shed its outer organic shell, revealing its mechanical insides.  It begins to release a stream of Cursed Flames towards you.  At the same time, Retinazer starts to dash towards you.
