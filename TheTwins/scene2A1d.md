You dodge Spazmatizm's oncoming rain of green fire, as you do, Retinazer flies into you, pushing you back.  As you hit the ground, you try to get yourself up and ready your weapons.  Suddenly, Spazmatizm begins violently dashing around.  You use your storm bow to rain the Holy arrows on Spaz, and as you do he begins to crumble into pieces!  One down, one to go!
