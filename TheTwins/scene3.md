# Mage

Choosing Mage, you have a few options for what kind of build you want to use.  You prepare your magical staff made from asteroid rock to summon meteors down to rain on your enemies, as well as the Sky Fracture to release swords made of light onto your enemies.  Wearing armor made from the strongest Titanium you could find, as well as your Mana Cloak, you walk out to your arena to ready yourself for the arrival of The Twins.
