As Spazmatizm rushes towards you, you prepare your Sky fracture and release dozens of swords into the giant eye, leaving it greatly wounded.  It begins to spin and shed its outer organic shell, revealing its mechanical insides.  It begins to release a stream of Cursed Flames towards you.  At the same time, Retinazer starts to dash towards you.
