# Summoner

Choosing Summoner means you have lower defense, but have the added benefit of minions to aid you in combat.  There aren't many choices for you, but what you do have is quite strong.  Your armor set is made from the fangs of the the giant Black Recluse, along with your weapon, a spider staff to summon tiny spiders to aid you in combat, and finally a Whip made with an Ice Core.  You can be easily wounded, but can take down The Twins with ease.
