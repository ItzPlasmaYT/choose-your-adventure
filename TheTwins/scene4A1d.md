You dodge Spazmatizm's oncoming rain of green fire, as you do, Retinazer flies into you, pushing you back.  As you hit the ground, you try to get yourself up and ready your weapon.  Suddenly, Spazmatizm begins violently dashing around.  You use your Cool Whip and freeze Spaz, and as you do, your spiders deal a killing blow and he begins to crumble into pieces!  One down, one to go!
